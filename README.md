# Automated Malware Analysis

This PowerShell script provides an automated solution for detecting and analyzing malware on Windows systems. It leverages Sysmon events to monitor process creation and file changes, and integrates with external services to identify known malware signatures and reputations.

## Features

- Continuously monitors the system for new process creation and file changes using Sysmon events.
- Performs malware analysis on new processes by checking them against the VirusTotal API for known malware signatures.
- Analyzes changed files by calculating their hash and checking their reputation using a custom file reputation service (in this case, ThreatMiner).
- Logs the detected malware and takes appropriate mitigation actions, such as stopping processes and deleting files.
- Demonstrates advanced PowerShell techniques, including event log parsing, API integration, and custom function implementation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rozcy/automated-malware-analysis.git
```
2. Open the PowerShell script file (`MalwareAnalysis.ps1`) and update the API keys for VirusTotal and ThreatMiner (or any other file reputation service you'd like to use).
3. Run the script:
```powershell
.\MalwareAnalysis.ps1
```
4. The script will continuously monitor the system and perform malware analysis, taking appropriate mitigation actions when threats are detected.
